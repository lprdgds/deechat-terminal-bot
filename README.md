# DeeChat Terminal Bot 💬

A simple Python chatbot that runs in the terminal and talks like an AI coach.
It logs conversations and helps me learn AI and Python through real projects.

## 🧠 Why I Built This
I’m a top-down, project-first learner. I understand systems best by building them,
breaking them, and reverse-engineering how they work. This is my first public AI project.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenAI API

## 🚀 How It Works
- User types a message in the terminal
- The bot sends it to the OpenAI API
- The response is printed and logged to a file

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Add multiple personalities (claims coach, trading coach, etc.)
- Turn this into a web app
- Add memory using files or a database
